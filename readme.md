# A clone of [Encyclopaedia Metallum](https://www.google.comhttps://www.metal-archives.com/)

I built this mostly to be able to use the info of metal-archives on mobile.

Built with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel), [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss).

And powered by the database from [Metallum](https://github.com/mauriciv/metallum).
